- **Trendspotting Tuesdays** – highlight current fashion trends and how your brand interprets them.
- **Work-in-Progress Wednesdays** – share sneak peeks of designs or materials in development.
- **Throwback Thursdays** – revisit past collections or fashion history inspiration.
- **Feature Fridays** – spotlight a specific product or style and how to style it.

## 5-Day Schedule

| Day | Theme & Story Angle | Trending Sound | Script Idea | Call to Action |
|-----|--------------------|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Day 1** | *Behind the Brand*: Introduce the design team using quick clips of each member. | "Take It On the Run" | "You’ve seen the styles, now meet the creators." | "Follow for more behind-the-scenes magic." |
| **Day 2** | *Trendspotting*: Show how a trending color or fabric is incorporated into a new outfit. | "Chapel Of Love" | "Fall in love with this season’s must-have fabric." | "Comment your favorite shade." |
| **Day 3** | *Work-in-Progress*: Use AI visuals to reveal sketches transforming into samples. | "Stress tension suspense mystery" | "From concept to creation—watch the journey." | "Save this video to watch the final reveal." |
| **Day 4** | *Throwback*: Feature a best-selling piece from the archive and its inspiration. | "Fuck me baby" | "A classic never goes out of style." | "Which vintage look should we bring back?" |
| **Day 5** | *Feature Friday*: Showcase a finished outfit with a mini-story of how it’s styled for a big event. | "We Did It" | "Ready for the weekend—here’s the perfect statement look." | "Tap the link in bio to shop." |

These prompts pair trending music from TikTok Creative Center with story-based scripts to engage viewers. Mix AI-generated visuals—like virtual try-ons or 3D fabric textures—to add unique flair and reinforce your brand’s identity.
