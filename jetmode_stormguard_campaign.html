        <h1>AD CAMPAIGN GENERATOR_OUTPUT</h1>
        <p class="slogan">WEAR THE STORY / FRAME THE STYLE</p>

        <h2>CAMPAIGN: JETMODE StormGuard Collection</h2>
        <p>This campaign targets the urban explorer, the digital nomad, the creative who moves through the city like it's a cinematic set. The narrative is about owning the storm, whether it's digital noise or a downpour at 3 AM.</p>

        <h2>1. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <h3>Product: JETMODE StormGuard Tactical Jacket</h3>
        <code>
            **Title:** JETMODE StormGuard Tactical Jacket - Conquer the Elements. Command the Street.

            **Body:**
            The city has its own weather system. Static, signal, storm. The JETMODE StormGuard Jacket is your armor for all of it. Engineered with waterproof, multi-layered fabric and a tactical silhouette, this isn't just a jacket—it's a statement of intent.

            Featuring sealed seams, deep-set cargo pockets for your tech, and a contoured hood that frames your focus, the StormGuard moves with you, not against you. The minimalist "JETMODE" branding hits with quiet confidence, while the "STORMGUARD" emblem on the sleeve and back serves as a badge of resilience.

            This is your shield for the concrete jungle. Built for the journey, not the destination.

        <h2>2. AI MODEL IMAGE PROMPT (Midjourney/DALL-E)</h2>
        <h3>Objective: Create a high-contrast, cinematic shot for social media.</h3>
        <code>
            **Prompt:**
            An androgynous model with sharp, empowered features standing in a rain-slicked Las Vegas alley at night. They are wearing a black techwear jacket ("JETMODE StormGuard") and baggy cargo pants. The background is a blur of neon signs, reflecting puddles on the ground. The lighting is high-contrast and cinematic, with a single neon pink light source casting dramatic shadows. The model's pose is confident and defiant, looking directly at the camera. Shot on a Sony A7S III, 35mm lens, editorial fashion style, ultra-realistic, 8K.

        <h2>3. SCENE SCRIPT (15-Second Reel)</h2>
        <h3>Title: 3 AM. LAS VEGAS. THE STORM HITS.</h3>
        <code>
            [SCENE START]

            **(0-2 seconds)**
            VISUAL: Extreme close-up on the "STORMGUARD" text on the jacket sleeve. Raindrops bead on the fabric.
            AUDIO: Glitchy static sound effect.

            **(2-6 seconds)**
            VISUAL: Quick cuts. A hand zipping up the jacket. A reflection in a puddle showing neon lights. The model pulling the hood up. The cuts are synced to a heavy synthwave beat.
            AUDIO: Music starts: driving, dark synthwave track.

            **(6-12 seconds)**
            VISUAL: Full shot of the model standing confidently in the neon-lit, rainy alley, as described in the image prompt. They turn their head slowly towards the camera. A digital data overlay flickers across the screen for a split second.
            AUDIO: Music swells. A deep, resonant bass drop.

            **(12-15 seconds)**
            VISUAL: The ClipOpera circular mask logo appears, followed by the text: "JETMODE STORMGUARD. THE CITY IS YOURS."
            AUDIO: Music fades with a final glitch sound.

            [SCENE END]
